# TaskOrganizer
Control your project tasks: assign priority, mark as completed and distribute tasks to your team members! Don't forget to encourage the most hardworking subordinates.

## Key features description
* Create managers and different subordinate users, which can be Junior, Middle or Senior. Link them with their managers.
* Create tasks of different priority (urgent, high, middle and low) and add them to both the manager's and the subordinate's task list. Manager can get rid of his task by assigning it to subordinate.
* Subordinate can complete task, add report and send it for approval to manager.
* Manager can whether to approve or to reject subordinate's work.
    * In the first case, the subordinate automatically receives scores depending on the priority type of the completed task.
    * In the second case, changes requested. The task becomes uncompleted and is being sent back to sabordinate for revision.

So control subordinates' success and check their scores from time to time. Don't forget to raise their position if they have scores enough.
